<p>ROBERT SAPOLSKY is a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University and of neurology at Stanford's School of Medicine. He is also a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya. While his primary research, on stress and neurological disease, is in the laboratory, for twenty-three years he has made annual trips to the Serengeti of East Africa to study a population of wild baboons and the relationship between personality and patterns of stress-related disease in these animals.</p>


<p>His latest book,<i> A Primate's Memoir,</i> grew out of the years spent in Africa.
He is also the author of <i>Stress, the Aging Brain, and the Mechanisms
of Neuron Death,</i> and two books for nonscientists,  <i>The Trouble
With Testosterone and Other Essays on the Biology  of the Human
Predicament</i> and <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: A Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases  and Coping.</i></p>
